# Linear Stability Analysis

Since we sometimes model neurons using differential equations, our neural networks can become dynamical systems
(systems of differential equations). To understand the functioning of these networks, it is oftern helpful to
study the stability of different equilibrium states. Here is a brief tutorial on linear stability analysis.
